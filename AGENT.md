# üõ∞Ô∏è FRBExplorer AGENT.md

---

## üìã Overview

This document is a comprehensive agent-style guide for the **FRBExplorer** project ‚Äî a fully static, JavaScript-driven web portal to display Fast Radio Burst (FRB) data, repeater information, and interactive plots. It is designed as a replacement for the discontinued FRBSTATS site and runs entirely on static hosting with no backend dependencies.

---

## üîç Purpose

- Replace the original FRBSTATS website with a **static, client-side only** site.
- Provide dynamic data visualization (tables, charts) entirely in the browser.
- Use pre-generated JSON data files to avoid live API calls or server-side processing.
- Support easy updates by regenerating JSON files offline from NASA and related astronomical datasets.
- Deploy on simple FTP hosting with no backend capabilities (e.g., one.com).

DO NOT PUSH ANYTHING to pulsars.json catalogue.json or repeaters.json this files are supposed to be automatically populated but the web it self!!!!

## ‚öôÔ∏è Data Source and Update Workflow

### Data Origin  
- Original FRB and repeater data are published by scientific organizations like NASA/JPL, CHIME, LIGO, Breakthrough Listen, etc.  
- These organizations provide raw astronomical datasets related to Fast Radio Bursts and related phenomena.

## all files are to be pupulated automatically by the webpage

## website limits: html/js

### Data Usage on Site  
- The website does **not** query any API or database live.  
- It loads static JSON files via AJAX/fetch in the browser, rendering data dynamically with JavaScript.  
- This ensures fast page loads and no server-side processing needed.

---

## üß© Frontend Architecture

### JavaScript Logic (`js/script.js`)  
- Loads JSON data files asynchronously using fetch/XHR.  
- Parses JSON to extract relevant data points for tables and charts.  
- Utilizes libraries like DataTables or Tabulator for interactive tables (sorting, filtering, pagination).  
- Uses Chart.js or similar for plotting scatter plots, histograms, or line charts.  
- Handles UI events such as search input, filter toggles, and plot interactions.  

### CSS Styling (`css/`)  
- Provides responsive and clean layout with possible use of Bootstrap or custom CSS.  
- Ensures usability across devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).  
- Applies theming consistent with scientific data visualization standards.

### HTML Pages  
- Minimal static markup with placeholders for dynamic content insertion by JS.  
- Includes links to CSS and JS files with correct relative paths.  
- Contains semantic HTML elements for accessibility and SEO.

## üöÄ Deployment Instructions

1. **Prepare static build:**  
   - Ensure all `.html`, `.css`, `.js`, JSON data files, images, and vendor libraries are correctly placed and linked.  
   - Use relative paths for all resource references.  

2. **Local testing:**  
   - Run a local HTTP server (e.g., `python -m http.server`) to test functionality and avoid CORS issues.  
   - Verify data loads, tables render correctly, and plots appear as expected.  

3. **Upload to hosting:**  
   - Use FTP or file manager to upload all files maintaining folder structure.  
   - Upload to the public root or designated web directory.  

4. **Verify live site:**  
   - Open the site in browsers, check console for errors, ensure smooth interaction.

## üîÑ Maintenance and Data Updates

- To update data:  
  1. Run site scripts to fetch and process the latest raw FRB data.  
  2. Replace `catalogue.json`, pulsars.json and `repeaters.json` files on the server with newly generated versions.  
  4. Upload via FTP to web domain server.  

- Regular updates keep site scientifically relevant and accurate.

## ‚ùó Limitations and Considerations

- No live API or server-side data querying ‚Äî all data must be pre-generated.  
- Large JSON files can impact initial load times; consider data pagination or compression if needed.  
- Site relies on client browser JS; ensure users have JS enabled.  
- Hosting on simple FTP limits server-side features (e.g., user accounts, logging).  
- CORS and path issues can arise if relative URLs or folder structures are not consistent.
